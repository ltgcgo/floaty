# Floaty
> **Warning**
> 
> We no longer have a need for Floaty, as Lightingale Community is moving to [HAProxy](https://haproxy.org) and [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) for high-performance low-overhead reproducible load balancing. We suggest the same for anyone with performance-critical workloads to move load balancing away from Caddy.

☁️ Prevent loopbacks... Without traceability.

This is a Caddy plugin that adds customizable rolling instance IDs, permitting loopback prevention while maximizing difficulty in tracing.
